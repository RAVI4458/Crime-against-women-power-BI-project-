# Project Title: "Data-Driven Insights on Crimes Against Women in India: A Comprehensive Dashboard Analysis"



## Introduction
The project, "Crime Against Women in India", is a data visualization and analytics initiative to highlight the prevalence, trends, and geographical distribution of crimes against women in India. It provides insights into various categories of crimes, their year-wise trends, and the performance of states in terms of crime reporting and management. This analysis aims to assist policymakers, researchers, and the public in understanding the severity and tackling the issue effectively.



## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Crimes Reported: 5 million
Total Domestic Violence: 2 million
Total Dowry Death: 159K
Total Kidnap & Abduction Incident: 835K
Total Women Trafficking : 21K
Crime by State Analysis:
States with the highest crime rates (e.g., Uttar Pradesh).
States with the lowest crime rates (e.g., Lakshadweep).

## Overview of the Dashboard

 ## Dashboard 1
  ## 1. Pie Chart - Proportion of Crime Types

 - Description: Represents the percentage distribution of major crimes:

  Domestic Violence (51.84%):
  The largest proportion of crimes falls under domestic violence, accounting for more than half of the total     crimes reported.
   This suggests that domestic violence is a predominant issue and requires significant attention.

    Kidnapping & Abduction (22.66%):

 The second largest crime type involves kidnapping and abduction, indicating threats to womenâ€™s physical safety and freedom.
 This highlights the need for better law enforcement and preventive measures.

 Assault on Minors (6.65%):
 
 Crimes involving minors, such as physical or sexual assault, make up a smaller but still significant portion.
 This underlines the importance of child protection laws and awareness campaigns.

 Dowry Deaths (4.31%):
 
Dowry-related deaths account for a smaller share but are still a critical issue, particularly in culturally sensitive regions.
Persistent dowry practices and societal pressures may contribute to these figures.

- Purpose: Highlights which types of crimes are most prevalent.

-  Insight: Domestic violence constitutes the highest percentage, indicating a need for focused intervention.


 
   
 ## 2. Line Chart  - Yearly Trend of Total Crimes

- Description: Tracks the number of total crimes reported from 2017 to 2020. 

 - 2017 :

The number of crimes reported in 2017 was 306K
This serves as the baseline for comparison.

 - 2018 :

A slight increase was observed in 2018, with a total of 314K  cases reported.
This indicates a steady rise in reported crimes during this period.

 - 2020 :

A noticeable decline was recorded in 2020, with 302K  cases reported.
This drop could potentially be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, where lockdowns and restricted movement may have led to underreporting of crimes or fewer opportunities for certain crimes to occur.
 
 - 2021 :

A sharp rise to 348K  was observed in 2021, the highest value in the dataset.
This may indicate a post-pandemic resurgence in crimes or better reporting mechanisms.

- Description: Tracks the number of total crimes reported from 2017 to 2021.
- Purpose: Analyzes whether crimes have increased or decreased over the years.
- Insight: Identifies years where crime rates spiked or declined, providing context for further investigation.

## 8.    Map chart - "overview of rape incidents by state in India."

 Map Background:

The map highlights the geographical region of India and its surrounding countries for context.
It uses a dark theme, making the plotted points more visible.

 - Data Points (Orange Dots):

Each orange dot represents a state or region where rape incidents have been recorded.
The size or clustering of dots could represent the concentration or number of incidents
in a specific area (though the size doesn't seem to vary significantly in this chart).

-  Purpose of the Visual:

To highlight geographic trends and spatial distribution of rape incidents in India.
Provides a visual summary for better understanding and actionable insights (e.g., where intervention or policy focus might be needed).


## Purpose 

The primary purpose of this project is to equip policymakers with actionable 
insights to support data-driven decision-making and craft targeted interventions. It aims to raise publ
ic awareness by providing a clear understanding of crime trends and the urgency of addressing them. The
 project also enhances accountability by enabling stakeholders to measure the effectiveness of existing laws and policies. 

## Conclusion:

The analysis underscores the alarming prevalence and diversity of crimes against women in India.
 Domestic violence, kidnapping, and dowry deaths emerge as key areas of concern. State-wise analysis 
 reveals a disparity in crime prevalence, with some regions consistently underperforming in terms of womenâ€™s safety.
   Temporal trends indicate the impact of societal and external factors,
 such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on crime reporting and incidence.
